# Mass-background-remover-for-photoshop.


Hello, thank you for checking out my project.

I run different shops on instagram and needed a quick and free mass image background remover.

But most of the scripts i found woulndt give me a transparent background, so i modified it a bit.

** HOW TO USE **

1.CREATE A NEW FOLDER NAMED "ps" IN YOUR C DRIVE (it should look like this C:\ps\out)

2.CREATE TWO MORE FOLDERS INSIDE NAMED 'OUT' AND 'SRC'

3. PUT THE IMAGES YOU WANT TO REMOVE THE BACKGROUND IN THE SRC FOLDER

4. DOWNLOAD THE SCRIPT

5. GO TO PHOTOSHOP -> FILE -> SCRIPT -> BROWSE (select the file you downloaded)

# Mass-background-remover-for-photoshop.


Hello, thank you for checking out my project.

I run different shops on instagram and needed a quick and free mass image background remover.

But most of the scripts i found woulndt give me a transparent background, so i modified it a bit.

** HOW TO USE **

1.CREATE A NEW FOLDER NAMED "ps" IN YOUR C DRIVE (it should look like this C:\ps\out)

2.CREATE TWO MORE FOLDERS INSIDE NAMED 'OUT' AND 'SRC'

3. PUT THE IMAGES YOU WANT TO REMOVE THE BACKGROUND IN THE SRC FOLDER

4. DOWNLOAD THE SCRIPT

5. GO TO PHOTOSHOP -> FILE -> SCRIPT -> BROWSE (select the file you downloaded)




If you want it to save with a solid color background uncomment the code from line 36 to 57 code and comment the code from 57 to 85
